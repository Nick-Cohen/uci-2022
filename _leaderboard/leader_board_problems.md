title: Tuning Phase Leaderboard Problem Sets
---

## Problem files
For traditional inference tasks, we are using UAI 2014 competition problem sets for the tuning phase leaderboard evaluations.  For MLC, we have newly generated sample problems.

The followings are links to ZIP files for each task.

  * [MAR.zip](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter/uaicompetition/2022/TuningBenchmarks/MAR.zip)
  * [MPE1.zip](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter/uaicompetition/2022/TuningBenchmarks/MPE.zip)
