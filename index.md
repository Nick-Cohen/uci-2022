> A main challenges of building intelligent systems is the ability to reason under uncertainty.  One of the most successful approaches for dealing with this challenge is via use of probabilistic graphical models which provide a flexible framework for describing large, complex, heterogeneous collections of variables. Probabilistic inference of these models is important for a variety of desired applications in medical diagnosis, sensor fusion, automated help systems, credit assessment, computational biology, computer vision, data mining, and many more.  Since inference across larger, more complex, problems is generally intractable, many approximation schemes have been developed relying on a vast array of methods including variational approaches, search, sampling, and learning from data.  The goal of this challenge is to explore your various approaches of approximating the MAP, marginals, or partition function of models by evaluating them on an array of problems with varying difficulties.  We hope this event can fuel the continued growth of these algorithms as well as lead to potential new collaborations.
