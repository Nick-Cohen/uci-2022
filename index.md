> Probabilistic inference in graphical models is a key task in many applications, from machine vision to computational biology. 
Since the problem is generally computationally intractable many approximations have been suggested over the years.
The goal of this challenge is to evaluate inference algorithms on difficult large scale problems.
Algorithms for MAP, marginals, and partition function approximation will be evaluated. 
An online leaderboard will show the relative rankings of the algorithms.
