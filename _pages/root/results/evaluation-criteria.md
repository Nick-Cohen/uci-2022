## PR Task

For evaluating the results of different PR solvers,
we compute the errors of the partition function.

The error of a solver \\(solver\\) on the \\(i^{th}\\) instance is computed as follows. <br>

<p>

$$ 
\begin{align*}
  Err^{(i)}_{solver} &= | \log \frac{Z^{*}}{Z_{solver}} |,
\end{align*}
$$

where  
$$ Z^{*} $$ 
is the true partition function and 
$$ Z_{solver} $$  
is the approximate partition function computed by the solver.<br>

  
The final error for a solver is given by 
$$ Err_{solver} = sum_{i}Err_{solver}^{(i)}, $$
and 
the solver with least final error is decided as a winner.
<\p>

  
  
## MAR Task
  
For Evaluating the results produce by different MAR solvers we have used the following two metrics.
  
#### Hellinger Error
For the \\(i^{th}\\) problem the Hellinger error corresponding 
to a solver \\(M\\) is computed as follows. <br>

<p>
$$ 
\begin{align*}
 HErr_M^{(i)} &= frac{1}{N} sum_{j=1}^{N} Hell({bf P}^{*}(V_j),{bf P}(V_j)),
\end{align*}
$$
<\p>
where \\(N\\) is the total number of variables, 
\\(Hell({bf P}^{*}(V_j),{bf P}(V_j))\\) is the Hellinger distance between 
the true probability distribution corresponding to the 
\\(j^{th}\\) variable 
\\(({bf P}^{*}(V_j))\\) and 
the approximate one returned by the solver \\(({bf P}(V_j))\\). <br>

The final error for a solver \\(M\\) is given by 
\\(Err_M = sum_{i}HErr_M^{(i)}\\).
  
#### Max-Absolute Error
For the \\(i^{th}\\) problem 
the max absolute error corresponding to a solver \\(M\\) is computed as follows. <br>


<p>
$$ 
\begin{align*}
AErr_M{(i)} &= frac{1}{N} sum_{j=1}^{N} max_k |P^{*}(V_j = k)-P(V_j = k)|.
\end{align*}
$$
<\p>
where the true probability distribution corresponding to the 
\\(j^{th}\\) variable is 
\\(({bf P}^{*}(V_j))\\) and the approximate one returned by the solver is 
\\(({bf P}(V_j))\\). <br>

The final error for a solver \\(M \\) is given by 
\\(AErr_M = sum_{i}AErr_M^{(i)}\\).
  
  
## MAP Task
For Evaluating the results produce by different MAP solvers we have used following two metrics.

#### Relative Gap From the Leader


For each problem and for a solver \\( solver \\), 
the score \\( S(solver) \\) is computed as follows. <br>

<p>
$$ 
\begin{align*}
S(solver) &= \frac{M_{leader} - M_{solver}}{M_{leader}},
\end{align*}
$$
where \\(M_{solver}\\) is the \\(\log MAP\\) value of the result 
returned by \\(solver\\) and \\(M_{leader}\\) is the same for the best solver for this
problem instance, i.e., solver with the highest MAP value.

**Note**: For deciding the winner we have not used this metric as it gives higher importance to problem instances with smaller MAP value.
</p>

#### Rank
For each problem, 
each solver is ranked in terms of its solution quality, 
i.e.â€“ solvers with higher MAP value gets smaller rank and the winner(s) 
for that problem gets the rank 1. 
Finally we add all the ranks of a solver in all the problems. 
The winner of the competition is selected using this metric. 
The solver which has lowest cumulative score is decided as a winner.


## MMAP Task
For Evaluating the results produce by different MMAP solvers we 
use the same evaluation criteria used for MAP task.


## MLC Task
For Evaluating the results produce by different MLC submissions we 
use the same evaluation criteria used for MAP task.
