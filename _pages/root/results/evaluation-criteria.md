## MAP Task
For Evaluating the results produce by different MAP solvers we have used following two metrics:

#### **Relative Gap From the Leader**

<p>
For each problem and for a solver \\( solver \\), 
the score \\( S(solver) \\) is computed by <br>

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
S(solver) &= \frac{M_{leader} - M_{solver}}{M_{leader}},
\end{aligned}
$$
where \\(M_{solver}\\) is the \\(log MAP\\) value of the result 
returned by \\(solver\\) and \\(M_{leader}\\) is the same for the best solver for this
problem instance, i.e., solver with the highest MAP value.

**Note**: For deciding the winner we have not used this metric as it gives higher importance to problem instances with smaller MAP value.
</p>

#### **Rank**
For each problem, 
each solver is ranked in terms of its solution quality, 
i.e.â€“ solvers with higher MAP value gets smaller rank and the winner(s) 
for that problem gets the rank 1. 
Finally we add all the ranks of a solver in all the problems. 
The winner of the competition is selected using this metric. 
The solver which has lowest cumulative score is decided as a winner.
