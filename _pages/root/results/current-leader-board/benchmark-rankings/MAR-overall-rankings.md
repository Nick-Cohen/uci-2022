The results below are organized as follows:
- each table displays the cumulative task results for the given benchmark under different time limits
- scores are average normalized scores for only problems from the given benchmark evaluated as outlined in [Evaluation Criteria](https://uaicompetition.github.io/uci-2022/results/evaluation-criteria/)
- clicking on a solver name links to the results of the solver on the individual problem instances for all benchmarks
