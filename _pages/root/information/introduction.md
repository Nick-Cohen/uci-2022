> We are pleased to announce an upcoming evaluation of probabilistic approximate inference algorithms, as part of the UAI
2022 conference. 
All researchers working on inference in graphical models and statistical relational models are encouraged to participate.

##### The evaluation will focus on the following computational tasks:
* PR inference: 
computing the partition function and probability of evidence 
* MAR inference: 
computing the marginal probability distribution over a variable given evidence 
* MAP Inference: 
computing the most likely assignment to all variables given evidence 
* MMAP Inference: 
computing the most likely assignment to a subset of variables that maximizes the marginals on the remaining variables
