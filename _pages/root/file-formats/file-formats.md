## Competition File Formats
Here we outline file formats used for the competition, known as the UAI Format.  There
are four aspects to the UAI Format:
* a format describing the problem's model
* a format describing what evidence is to be conditioned on
* a format denoting the variables for which we wish to query
* a file outlining final results
The description of each (respectively) can be found below.  At the end of the page,
you will also find sample models and evidence for each to be conditioned on.


#### UAI File Format Descriptions
* [model formats](./model-format.md)
* [evidence formats](./evidence-format.md)
* [query formats](./query-format.md)
* [result formats](./result-format.md)

##### Sample Problems
